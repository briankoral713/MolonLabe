NYC Covid-19 Data 

Includes full data since the start of the Covid19 outbreak by total cases, daily cases, hospitalizations, deaths, broken down by age group.

The third sheet in the file holds the latest updated numbers from the master file here.  

Please utilize this 3rd sheet for the latest numbers - reason being that the prior daily case numbers were as of date of test results not date of diagnosis.  

Also why does the total deaths to total deaths ratio also increase by a near perfect 1% every day?  The increase in total deaths always outedges the increase in hospitalizations by 1% every day...it is intriguing...
